### Have you ever received a great gift?

Yeah, I once received a great gift that I will never forget.

It was on Thanksgiving Day that I got a letter from my girlfriend telling me she loved me and gave me a nice pair of shoes. And these shoes feature my favorite color scheme.

I will never forget this gift, and I will never forget my girlfriend's love for me
