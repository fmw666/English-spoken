Newton's Laws of Motion

Newton's laws can help us to understand how cars, bikes, and many other things move, even people. Let's talk a litlle bit about when we see the men everyday life.

In simple terms, the first law are law of inertion, occurse when an object remains still or is on something moves it. The second law is used to explain why a texi takes less force to make a bike move forward than something that's havier like a car. The third law are action and reaction, happens when you throw a ball against the wall and it bounces. Every action no matter how small and simple, has a reaction.

Before exploring each of the laws, let's go over the meaning of motion: force and acceleration. The three concepts of the key to understanding Newton's laws. We all know what motion is, when something goes from one place to anohter are changes its position. For example is, this duck walks it's moving to the new place, but also moves when it's simply lower it's neck to drink some water, changing it's position. Force is when any action, such as dropping, pushing, or dragging, cause an object to move or change its shape.

Joe wants to pick up the box it's on the floor to put on the table, so she is using force when she graps the box, then set up, she is making the box changing places. But if Joe is tired, and leans on the box, she is also exgersiong force. Her body cause to change shape. Lastly there is acceleration. Acceleration describes when something like a car speeds up or when it's slows down. Keep these three key words in mind as you learn about each law, Newton's laws of motion are happening all over around us, they can help us to make a sense of a world that to see things in a unique way.
