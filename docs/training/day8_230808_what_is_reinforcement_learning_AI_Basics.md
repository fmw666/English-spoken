The road bot uses this feedback to learn and improve it's desicion making abilitis. and overtime it gets better at narrigating the room. Feels like robate, gaming and recurmindation systems, reinforcement learning to improve performance. They ability to learn from mistakes and get better overtime, makes reinforcement learning increadible to AI, the patiencially uses of this technolige are similarly endless. And we just begin the surface what's possible. AI is ability to in a dept has pretential to transform entiry industries, create innovations, and often benefit society as a whole.
