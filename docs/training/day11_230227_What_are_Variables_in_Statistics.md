Statistics basic concepts, variables. In statistics, variables are numbers or characteristics that can be counted or measured. For example, age, length and weight could be variables, even the height of a building. Each of these numbers represents a variable which can change or take on different values.

For example, Lucas has just met the five newest members of his family. He wants to keep an eye on their health, so he starts recording their weight. Kiara is the smallest of the litter, weighing 4.5 pounds. Then there's Simba, who's 5 pounds, Rocky 4.8, Nala 4.6, and Bruno who's 5. In this case, the variable is weight, which changes depending on the dog. If Lucas wanted to track their growth more closely, he could measure other variables like their height or length, giving him a larger data set, which just means more information.

These types of variables are called quantitative variables, which can be expressed or reflected in numbers. But there are also qualitative variables too, which are characteristics that can only be expressed in words for people. It might be things like ethnicity, profession, or gender. If Lucas decided to replace his quantitative variables with qualitative ones, he could swap the numbers for traits like the dog's coat or eye color. These variables are descriptive, using words rather than numbers.

As you can see, there are different types of variables we can consider when collecting data. To learn more basic concepts in statistics, check out our other videos or the free tutorial on our website at GCF global.org. GCF Global, creating opportunities for a Better Life.
