在视频开始之前，先跟大家道个歉，上个视频说准备视频一天一更，但因为自己还在英语学习初期阶段，所以目前只能二天一更。关于今天的视频内容，我想来聊一下我认为应该如何学好英语。

我认为学任何东西都应该抱有目的，否则你很难有计划的学成一样东西。而对于学英语来说目的同样也能有很多种，有的人可能是为了应对考试，有的人是为了听懂，听懂英文，无论你是网上看视频学习或者追剧，我认为都是很重要的。也有的人是为了能和英语使用者做日常交流。当然也可以同时抱有多个目的去学。我的目的很简单，一句话就能描述，能让我作为第二语言在日常生活中使用即可。虽然能用一句话描述，但是所包含的内容这可不是一件轻松的事，我需要花更多的力气去做好

那在我的英语学习计划之中是如何安排的呢？首先第一步我认为学好音标至关重要，作为每个单词正确发音的基础，你应该了解每个音标的正确读音，这样无论你是在听或者说的时候都能敏锐的捕捉到每个单词对应是什么。这也是我目前正在学习的阶段。
第二步，我认为是大量的听，尤其是听大量的本地人口语对话，如果不是生活在英语使用地区，你很难培养你的英语听力能力。所以你需要主动的让自己接触到频繁的英语使用场景，最简单的就是通过观看美剧或英剧。接着你应该去总结这些英语母语者在日常对话中的一些连读规则或技巧，如果你只按照每个单词完整的音标去听这些人的对话，你一定会听的一头雾水。因为这种英语连读策略会让很多单词的发音产生变化，你需要去学习和掌握这种规律，培养自己更多的敏感度。
第三步就是投入实践，去大量的应用，你要尽可能勇敢的去多说英语，永远不要害怕犯错，就像你在学习你的母语时，你同样会犯大量的错，但你就是在通过不断的说不断的用不断的练习，逐渐掌握了你的母语。第二语言的学习也是同样的道理。
关于这一点我想补充的是，我之前看过一部日剧，叫龙樱，这部剧讲述的是一个暴走律师带领学校几个成绩很差的高中学生们考上全日本最好的大学东京大学的故事。我印象深刻的有一段是，其中有个男生英语很差，男主让他每天在YouTube上上传一段视频，内容可以是任意形式，但是只能说英语。通过这种方式，该男生在兴趣中培养了英语学习习惯，最后也取得了不错的成绩。所以，我现在目前所做的事也是通过这个例子受到的启发。

最近，我希望我说的这些对大家有所帮助，我们下个视频再见。

Before starting the video, I want to apologize to everyone. In the last video, I mentioned planning to upload a new video every day, but due to being in the early stages of learning English, I can currently only manage to upload every two days. Now, let's talk about today's video content, where I'd like to discuss how I believe one should go about learning English.

I think that having a purpose is essential when learning anything; otherwise, it's challenging to plan and achieve your goals. The purpose of learning English can vary — some may be preparing for exams, some for better understanding, whether it's watching videos online or following a series. Others may aim to engage in daily conversations with English speakers. Of course, it's possible to have multiple purposes. My goal is simple: to be able to use English as a second language in my daily life. Though it's a concise goal, achieving it requires a considerable effort.

So, how do I organize my English learning plan? The first step, in my opinion, is mastering pronunciation. Knowing the correct pronunciation of each phonetic symbol is crucial as it forms the foundation for pronouncing every word accurately. This is the current stage I'm focusing on.

The second step involves extensive listening, particularly to native speakers' conversational English. If you don't live in an English-speaking area, it's challenging to develop your listening skills. Therefore, you need to actively expose yourself to frequent English usage, and a simple way to do that is by watching American or British TV series. Afterward, you should analyze the connected speech rules or techniques used in everyday conversations by native speakers. If you only listen to each word's complete phonetic pronunciation, you'll likely find it confusing, as English connected speech strategies can alter the pronunciation of many words. Learning and mastering these patterns will help enhance your sensitivity.

The third step is to put what you've learned into practice. Use English extensively, speak as much as possible, and never be afraid of making mistakes. Just like when you learned your native language, you made numerous errors but gradually mastered it through continuous practice. Learning a second language follows the same principle.

Regarding this, I want to add that I watched a Japanese drama called "Dragon Sakura" where a passionate lawyer helped a group of low-performing high school students to get into the top university in Japan, the University of Tokyo. One memorable part was a student with poor English skills who was instructed to upload a daily video on YouTube, speaking only in English. Through this method, the student developed an English learning habit within his interests and eventually achieved good results. Inspired by this example, I'm currently following a similar approach.

I hope what I've shared is helpful for you. See you in the next video!
