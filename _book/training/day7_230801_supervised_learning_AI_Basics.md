Supervised learning in AI

Supervised learning is one of the three main types of artificial intelligence, it's all about teaching computers to learn using examples. During supervised learning, the computer is provided with lots of examples, and told the right answer for each one. The computer leans from this information, allow it to now guess the correct answer for new things that it's never seen before. For example, let's see we want to a computer to learn how to recognize different kinds of food. We can showed computer pictures of apples, oranges and bananas, and tell it which food is shown in which picture. Once the computer has seen enough, it's start to recognize the feature that make each food you need like: the shape, color and texture. Now when you showed a computer a new picture that it has never seen before, it can make a prediction about what kind of food it is, based on what it's learned.

Supervised learning can be applied too lots of things, such as the dectecting credit card flowed, identify spam emails, and even diagnosing medical conditions. Computers can learn to recognize patterns and make predictions, and learn promise that it can help us to dress some of todays biggest challenges and help us to create a better world.
