I once made a mistake on a university project by underestimating the time needed. The feedback highlighted my oversight and lack of thoroughness. In response, I learned to allocate more time for research and planning in subsequent projects.

我记得在大学期间我参与了美国大学生数学建模大赛，我错误的预估了模型建立的算法难度，以至于没能及时解决这一问题。在比赛后的复盘中，我的队友告诉了我，这场比赛失误的地方在于因为和队友的沟通不顺利，导致模型建立的太复杂，不能很好的实现我们所提出的方案，我充分采纳了这个建议，我自己也认为在后面的类似团队协作处理问题时，应该在前期投入更多的交流，在确定好最终方案后才能正确完成好目标。因此在后面有幸又参与到数学建模大赛，在这次中，我们团队取得了好的成绩。

During my time at university, I took part in the Mathematical Contest In Modeling.   I made a mistake by underestimating the complexity of the algorithm for building the model, which resulted in a delayed solution.

In the post-competition review, my teammates pointed out that the communication issues between us led to a needlessly complex model, hindering the implementation of our proposed solution.   I fully embraced this feedback.   I realized that, in similar team collaborations, effective communication in the early stages is crucial.

So, in subsequent instances, I made sure to invest more in communication before finalizing the approach.   Fortunately, I had the opportunity to participate in another mathematical modeling competition, and our team finally achieved good results.


关于这个问题，在我的印象中最深的一段经验是我刚才参加工作后不久，因为该公司的业务比较多，我又作为新人刚入职不久，需要我学习和了解的内容也很多，但是我的职责又是和公司商业战略布局有关，团队很信任我，也很需要我。我感受到了很大的压力，不仅仅是因为我需要做出更多努力来反馈团队，而且我需要转换心态来处理更多未来职场上的风险。
我通常会选择用动起来的方式来排解我的工作压力，比如我会选择跑步或者跳舞。因为在我动起来的过程当中，我的脑子只专注于我当前的动作，这段期间，我的大脑处于了休息的状态，并且在运动后，洗一个热水澡，好好的睡一觉，也有利于我第二天更专注于我所做的工作。

Talking about this issue, a standout experience for me was right after I started my new job.   The company had a lot going on, and being a new hire, there was a ton to learn and grasp.   What made it even more challenging was that my role was closely tied to the company's overall business strategy, and the team really relied on me.   That brought on some serious pressure!

It wasn't just about putting in extra effort.  I also had to shift my mindset to handle the uncertainties that come with the whole work scene.   It felt like diving into the deep end.

So, my go-to stress buster?   Getting active – whether it's a good run or a bit of dancing.   When I'm in motion, my mind is all about the moves, like a breather for my brain.   After sweating it out, a hot shower, a solid night's sleep – that combo sets me up to tackle whatever work throws at me the next day.
