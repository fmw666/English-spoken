A: Yeah.

B: Connie this is John Sturgis.

A: Well hello John Sturgis. How are you.

B: I chipped a tooth on a peach pit this morning, but otherwise I'm okay.

A: Good, good to hear it.

B: Next order of business, I would like to have dinner with you tonight, just the two of us.

A: Oh, well, that sounds nice. Would you have in mind?

B: I'd like to come to your house and cook you a SiChuan feast.

A: I'm sorry, what?

B: Sichuan, It's a style of Chinese cooking I learned when I was traveling through China.

A: Well wonderfull. I would love that.

B: Great. Do you have a wok?

A: I do not.

B: Not a problem. I have a travel wok.

A: Okay, so what do you say about 6.

B: It's a date.

A: Terrific.

B: Oh, and let's not mention this to Sheldon, so as to keep him from being underfoot.

A: Have you been talking to him?

B: I have. See you later.
