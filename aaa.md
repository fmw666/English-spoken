Good. Because the man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man.

Never tell anybody outside the family what you're thinking again.

I spent my life tryin' not to be careless. Women and children can be careless, but not men.

One thing I learned from Pop, was to try to think as people around you think.

My father taught me many things here. He taught me, "Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer."

Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgment.



康胎家丝 特要睿玩 that 

A:<br>
I **don**'t want to **run** my own country.<br>
I **just** want to pass 10th **gra**de.<br>
**So**, can't **I** just tell everyone that I simply **quit**?

B:<br>
No one can **quit being** who they really **are**, not even a **princess**.<br>
Now, you can refuse the **job**, but you are a **princess** by **birth**.

A:<br>
How can I tell if I can even **do** the job?

B:<br>
By simply, simply **trying**.<br>
Like the fancy **dinner** comming up.<br>
She **thinks** you're ready.

A:<br>
Really?

B:<br>
**Shall** we practice **entering** like a princess?

A:<br>
Okay~<br>
**Entering.**

B:<br>
At the grand **ball**, you enter with the **queen**.<br>
But at the state **dinner**, you **enter** unaccompanied.<br>
**Shoulders** back. Smile.<br>
They're all **happy** to see you.<br>
Ah, there she is.<br>
How is she?<br>

C:<br>
**You** are much prettier.
